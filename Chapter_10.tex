\section{Two Designs: Independent Samples \& Matched Pairs Sample}
\textbf{Treatment}: Things that are being compared. \\
\textbf{Experimental Subject}: The basic unit that is exposed to one treatment or another. \\
\textbf{Response}: The characteristic that is recorded after the application of a treatment to a subject.
\textbf{Experimental Design}: The manner in which subjects are chosen \& assigned to treatments. \\

For comparing two treatments, two basic types of design are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Independent Samples (Complete Randomization)}
    \item{Matched Pairs Sample (Randomization within each matched pair)}
\end{itemize}


\section{Inferences About The Difference of Means - Independent Large Samples}
With the design of \textit{independent samples}, we obtain:

\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
 \(X_1, X_2, ..., X_{n1}\) from population 1 & \(\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n_1}\Sigma_{i=1}^{n_1}X_i\) & \(S_1^2=\frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n_1}(X_i - \bar{X_i})^2}{n_1 - 1}\) \\ 
 \(X_1, X_2, ..., X_{n2}\) from population 2 & \(\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n_2}\Sigma_{i=1}^{n_2}X_i\) & \(S_1^2=\frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n_2}(X_i - \bar{X_i})^2}{n_2 - 1}\) \\

\title{Statistical Model: Independent Random Samples}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(X_1, X_2, ..., X_{n1}\) is a random sample of size \(n_1\) from population 1 whose mean is denoted by \(\mu_1\) and standard deviation by \(\sigma_1\).
    \item \(X_1, X_2, ..., X_{n2}\) is a random sample of size \(n_2\) from population 2 whose mean is denoted by \(\mu_2\) and standard deviation by \(\sigma_2\).
    \item The samples are independent. The response measurements under one treatment are unrelated to the response measurements under the other.
\end{itemize}
